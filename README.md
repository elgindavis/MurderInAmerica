# MurderInAmerica

The website and visualizations in this project were made by Elgin Davis, and the data analysis, scraping, and modeling were done by Elgin Davis, Kaitlyn Schiffauer, and Melissa Lee.

In our data analysis, we compiled data from the past 11 years of FBI crime statistics and U.S. Census data for the major metropolitan statistical areas in the country. Our project seeks to answer the question, 

"What models work best for different regions of the USA, and which predictors are consistently significant across all of its regions?"

Take a look at what we found.
